# Crystal's Python Projects

Hi! I'm Crystal Francis. Welcome to the repository where I make Python projects. When you skim through my other repositories, you will understand that I'm a web developer. Why am I studying Python, you may ask? As a programmer, I refuse to only stick to one field of computer science. I am currently exploring different fields in computing to see which one is more appealing to me. Now, I'm learning Python to get started with Artificial Intelligence. You can see my projects in this repository gradually getting more and more advanced as time passes. I hope to have a blast while I study Artificial Intelligence like I did while studying web development.
